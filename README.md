1. Tweet trends over time: Analyzes the tweet frequency over the 3 year period to identify any spikes aligned with major events during Trump's presidential campaign. Notable upticks were seen towards the end of his campaign in 2016.

2. Popular hashtags: Evaluates most used hashtags like #MAGA, #politics, #Trump indicating Russian troll support for Trump's campaign. Usage of these hashtags increased in 2016 leading up to elections.  

3. User mentions network: Intended to map out frequently mentioned users to visualize interactions. But ran into technical limitations with large dataset.

4. Clustering users by topics: Tried clustering users based on similar hashtags used but faced computational constraints from large hashtag vocabulary. Managed topic analysis by filtering qualifying hashtags.
